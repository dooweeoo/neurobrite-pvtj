# Getting Started

You will need a Muse 2016 and Python installed on your computer. With the exception of some of the stimulus presentation scripts, all code will work with Python 3.

The muse-lsl library that manages connecting to Muse and recording data is incorporated into this repo as a submodule. In order to get it up and running use the following commands:


Either: 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neurotechx/eeg-notebooks
```


Or: 

```
git clone https://github.com/neurotechx/eeg-notebooks
cd eeg-notebooks
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Install all requirements

`pip install requirements.txt`



(See [here](http://eeg-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_instructions_windows.html)


for more detailed setup instructions for windows operating systems)



To connect to your Muse and begin streaming data

`python muse-lsl/muse-lsl.py --name MUSE_YOURDEVICEID`

IMPORTANT: Leave this terminal running while you are recording data performing experiments

To visualize streaming data 

`python muse-lsl/lsl-viewer.py`

IMPORTANT: If you intend to collect data for an experiment, ensure that your signal quality is "excellent" and that there is very little noise before proceeding.

### Running an experiment

With the muse-lsl.py script running, open another terminal and run

`python stimulus_presentation/PARADIGM.py -d 120 & python muse-lsl/lsl-record.py -d 12`

where `PARADIGM.py` is one of the stimulus presentation scripts described above (e.g., `generate_Visual_P300.py`).

This will launch the selected paradigm and record data for 2 minutes. Consider repeating this 6 - 10 times in order to gather enough data.

After collecting data, move your recorded data CSVs to the data folder. Currently, notebook analysis scripts work with a `experiment/type/subjectNumber/sessionNumber` directory structure.

Open the Jupyter notebook relevant to the experiment your performed (e.g. `P300 with Muse.ipynb`) to analyze your data
