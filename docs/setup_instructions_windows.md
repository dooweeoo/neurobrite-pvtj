# muse-lsl + eeg-notebooks windows installation + setup instructions


## 1. Install miniconda

Miniconda is a 'mini' version of the anaconda python distribution.

Download the Windows miniconda installer from https://conda.io/miniconda.html (python 2.7 64-bit version)

Tip: you can check your windows operating system type in the Control Panel → System and Security → System

After the installation is complete, click on the Windows button and search for ‘Anaconda Prompt’ 
Tip: pin it to the Windows taskbar for easy access in the future

Click on Anaconda Prompt, which will bring up an anaconda terminal 

Create a conda environment for your neurobrite work:


`conda create -n “neurobrite”  python=2`

## 2. Download git for windows

Git is a version control system that will allow you to download and track changes to eeg notebooks. On Windows, it also gives you Git Bash, which is a useful linux-style terminal.

You can download git from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Run the installation with default settings

## 3. Get eeg-notebooks

You have two options, pick one from the following:

1) With git bash:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks`

de

2) Without git bash:

Navigate to the github repository (or https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks) directly in a web browser and download eeg-notebooks.

Now, you are ready to use the jupyter notebook.

## 4. Install python dependencies

Go back to your open Anaconda Prompt (or open a new one) and navigate to the location where you installed eeg-notebooks. You can use the `cd` command to change directories (i.e. `cd eeg-notebooks`)

Activate the neurobrite conda environment. Note: you will need to activate this environment every time you start a new terminal when you want to do work within the neurobrite environment we are about to setup

`conda activate neurobrite`

Now, install the dependencies identified in the requirements.txt file. Note: this may take a long time, up to 15 minutes

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 5. (Optional ) Install BlueMuse

[BlueMuse](https://github.com/kowalej/BlueMuse) is a Windows 10 program that allows communication between a Muse headband and a computer's native bluetooth drivers using the LSL communication protocol. It can be used as an alternative to an external BLED112 dongle. 

To install, go the the [ `BlueMUSE` github website](https://github.com/kowalej/BlueMuse) and follow the installation instructions.

## 6. Start a jupyter notebook session

Finally, start a jupyter notebook session from your Anaconda Promt in the eeg-notebooks directory

`jupyter notebook`

A browser should automatically open. If it doesn't, visit `localhost:8888`.

This should bring up the `eeg-notebooks` folder structure. You will find the list of available experiments in the `notebooks` folder.
